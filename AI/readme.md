## 1.  A* algorithm


### 1. Stacks Problem
We are given N stacks and M cubes, placed one over another in different stacks. We have to provide a solution to reach a Goal Configuration using A* algorithm, being allowed to move only the cubes on top. 

 


### 2. 8-Puzzle
8-Puzzle is a popular puzzle that consists of N tiles where N can be 8, 15, 24 and so on. The puzzle is divided into sqrt(N+1) rows and sqrt(N+1) columns. The puzzle can be solved by moving the tiles one by one in the single empty space and thus achieving the Goal configuration.

### 3.  Missionaries and cannibals problem
In the missionaries and cannibals problem, N missionaries and N cannibals must cross a river using a boat which can carry at most M people, under the constraint that, for both banks, if there are missionaries present on the bank, they cannot be outnumbered by cannibals (if they were, the cannibals would eat the missionaries). The boat cannot cross the river by itself with no people on board.

### 4. Searching for a way from a source to a destination
